## Project Components

### 1. Central SIEM Infrastructure
- Splunk Enterprise deployed on dedicated VM
- 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 40GB storage
- Receiving data on port 9997
- Web interface on port 8000

### 2. Distributed Forwarders
- Universal Forwarders on all monitored systems
- Collecting authentication, system, and application logs
- Lightweight deployment (~50-100MB RAM per agent)
- Automatic failover and buffering

### 3. Detection Rules
Implemented correlation searches including:
- Brute force authentication attempts
- Successful compromise after failed logins
- Privilege escalation patterns
- Lateral movement detection
- Anomalous login times
- Data exfiltration indicators

### 4. Monitoring Dashboards
- Security Events Overview
- Failed Authentication Tracker
- Sudo Command Monitoring
- Multi-host Activity Correlation
